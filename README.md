# CurrencyConverter
A Spring Boot-based currency converter application that enables real-time conversion between different currencies based on predefined exchange rates.

This project was built in just **2 hours** with the help of **Microsoft Copilot** during the **GitHub Copilot Fusion Hackathon - Season 4** hosted by **Cognizant L&D and Microsoft Github**.

It showcases:
- RESTful APIs for retrieving available currencies and exchange rates
- Dynamic calculation of reverse exchange rates if a direct rate is missing
- Clean architecture using layered design (Controller, Service, Repository, Entity)
